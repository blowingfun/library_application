# library_application 
This library program will only enable registered users to access entry through the system. If not registered already, the user
can create an account by inputting their username,password,name,last name,gender,email, and age. Once registered,
the program will input all of the users information into the database and will grant the user access. The program has two 
applications. The first application the program provides is the ability to change any information the user deem incorrect. 
The other application is to modify the books under the users accounts. The user will be able to either add books into their 
collection or return any books, removing it from their collection. However there is a limit of 5 books per account.
